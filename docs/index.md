## About

DACTYL (Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Large language models) is an AI-generated (AIG) text detection dataset created for my MPhil thesis project. 

We aim to build a dataset with the following properties:

- :thinking: Challenging AIG texts: Most AIG text datasets contain trivial examples. 
- :material-elevation-rise: Adaptable: We aim for living dataset that grows as AIG text detection evolves.
- :material-diversify: Diverse: We are currently at six domains, but we intend to expand to more.
